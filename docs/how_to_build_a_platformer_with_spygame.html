<h1>How to build a Platformer with spygame<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-build-a-platformer-with-spygame" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> <em>All graphics used in this documentation and in the spygame.examples.vikings package of the spygame library were taken from the game

for demonstration purposes only and then also mention this copyright statement!</em></p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will be building a 2D platformer level from scratch using the spygame library. After the first part of the tutorial (this page),
the game will look roughly like in the following picture and we will be able to control Erik the Swift (the dude with the red beard) via the arrow keys and the
space bar (to make him jump).</p>
<img alt="The final spygame game we will be building in this tutorial" src="_images/001_final_spygame_game.png" />
<p>In a later part of the tutorial (on the following pages), we will add further interesting objects and enemies to the level and also make
it look nicer via a few tricks.</p>
<p>You will need the following simple prerequisites to follow along with the different steps in this tutorial:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The “Tiled” editor to create spygame’s level-tmx files. A level-tmx file contains all necessary information for spygame to build a complete level, i.e.
background and foreground graphics, objects that the level will start with (e.g. player, enemies, traps, elevators, ladders, etc..).
You can <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mapeditor.org">download Tiled from here</a>.</li>
<li>The spygame library (currently this tutorial requires version 0.1a9 or later):
See our <a class="reference external" href="readme_link.html#get-the-code">Quick Setup Instructions</a> for all necessary details on how to get and install spygame.</li>
<li>Some asset files: Download the following two folders into the directory, in which you would like to develop the game. This will be the directory, in
which we will write the tutorial.py file (the only python file we are going to create and write to in this tutorial).<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>images/ (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sven1977/spygame/tree/master/examples/tutorial/images">from here</a>)</li>
<li>data/ (you can create this as an empty directory; we’ll be populating it from scratch with a level-tmx and some tsx (spritesheet) files)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="level-tmx-files">
<h2>Level tmx-files<a class="headerlink" href="#level-tmx-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our first step in building a platformer will be to create the level as a so called “level-tmx” file. A level-tmx file is nothing other than a regular
tmx file (which is a type of xml) that can be opened and edited with the Tiled editor. However, level-tmx files additionally support
spygame specific custom properties that spygame uses to tweak the behavior and look of a level and it allows the library to bring the level to life.</p>
<p>Let’s start by first opening the Tiled editor and then clicking on <em>File-&gt;New</em></p>
<img alt="Create a new level-tmx file" src="_images/002_file_new.png" />
<p>We define the size of our new level to be of 24x24 tiles, with 16x16px for each tile. We then click on <em>OK</em>:</p>
<img alt="Specify some initial properties for the level-tmx file" src="_images/003_file_new_specifics.png" />
<p>This is what our empty level should now look like:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/004_empty_level.png"><img alt="An empty level-tmx file ready to be populated" src="_images/004_empty_level.png" style="width: 768.5px; height: 469.5px;" /></a>
<p>We click on <em>File-&gt;Save As</em> and store the newly created tmx file in the data/ directory of our project folder as “tutorial.tmx”. This is the only file that
should be in the data/ directory right now.</p>
<img alt="Chose a filename for your new level-tmx file" src="_images/005_file_save_as.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="layers">
<h2>Layers<a class="headerlink" href="#layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> For the following, make sure you have the
<em>View-&gt;Views and Toolbars-&gt;Tilesets/Objects/Layers/Properties/Main Toolbar/Tools</em> all checked to be able to see your new tileset (and some
other things we need later) in the Tiled editor.</p>
<p>It’s time to work on our first layer of our level. A layer is a group of tiles that all have a common purpose and
that - if the layer is visible - get rendered at the same time.
The most commonly used layers in a level are the “collision layer”, the “background layer”, the “objects layer” and the “foreground layer”.
The collision layer is usually not visible (not rendered), the background layer usually gets rendered first, followed by the objects layer
(the player, enemies, special objects, etc..) and the foreground layer, which gets rendered last, so that it’s in the foreground.</p>
<p>There should already be one layer in the newly created tutorial.tmx file, called “Tile Layer 1”. We will rename this layer now to
“collision” by double clicking the layer in the Layers panel:</p>
<img alt="How to rename a layer" src="_images/005a_renaming_a_layer.png" />
<p>Now in order to place some tiles into this layer, we first have to generate one or more tilesets:</p>
<div class="section" id="tilesets">
<h3>Tilesets<a class="headerlink" href="#tilesets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tilesets are generated from special image files (usually a png file) whose content is arranged in a way that it can be easily split
(horizontally and vertically) into “tiles”. For example:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/007_tileset_ready_png_image.png"><img alt="A png file that's ready to become a tileset" src="_images/007_tileset_ready_png_image.png" style="width: 462.0px; height: 193.60000000000002px;" /></a>
<p>The first tileset we will create and then setup from such a png file will be a generic tileset that we will use to build our collision layer.
The tiles in this collision layer will not be rendered in the game.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-new-tilesets-from-png-files">
<h4>Creating new Tilesets from png Files<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-tilesets-from-png-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We click on <em>Map-&gt;New Tileset</em> and then on the <em>Browse</em> button to select an image that we will turn into a tileset.
From the images/ folder in our project, select the generic.png file and click on <em>Open</em>.</p>
<img alt="Creating a new tileset from scratch" src="_images/006_map_new_tileset.png" />
<p>We will leave the <em>Tile width/height</em> settings at 16px each (this will be the size for most of our tiles used for layers in this level) and click <em>OK</em>.
We should see the following now in the Tilesets panel of the editor. Our new tileset has 17 usable tiles (not counting the very first empty one).
We will use the tiles in the first row to create walls and (sloped) floors.
The tiles in the second row exist for other purposes (like defining an exit, etc..), but more on that in the next tutorial(s).</p>
<img alt="Our first tileset in the Tilesets panel" src="_images/008_our_first_tileset.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="modifying-tilesets-and-adding-properties-to-single-tiles">
<h4>Modifying Tilesets and Adding Properties to Single Tiles<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-tilesets-and-adding-properties-to-single-tiles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Next, we will add some properties to some of the tiles in the “generic” tileset so that spygame can recognize these tiles as proper collision tiles
and make sure its physics engine gets the idea of walls, floors and slopes (slopes will be covered only in the next tutorial).</p>
<p>If you right click on a tile, you can select <em>Tile Properties</em> and then you see in the Properties panel of the editor that the tile already has the
fixed properties ID, width and height. Note that the Properties panel might be at a very different location than the Tilesets panel in the editor.</p>
<img alt="" src="_images/009_changing_single_tiles_properties.png" />
<p>Width and height (in the Properties panel) should both be 16, since this is the size we chose when generating the tileset from the generic.png file.
We won’t really care about the ID property now or at any later time.</p>
<p>We now right click on the full red square tile, select “Tile Properties” and then click on the plus symbol at the bottom of the Properties panel
to add a new custom property.
We will call the new property <em>slope</em> and set its type to <em>float</em> and its value to <em>0.0</em>.
We then add another property called <em>offset</em> (again: <em>float</em>) and set its value
to <em>1.0</em>. These two
values basically describe the slope function for that tile. The slope function returns a y value (vertical axis) for each x-axis (horizontal axis) value.
X-axis values start at 0.0 at the very left edge of the tile and go to 1.0 at the very right edge of the tile. Similarly, y-axis values go from 0.0 at the
bottom edge of the tile to 1.0 at the top edge of the tile.
For example, for a fully filled tile, the slope function would be y=0x+1, where 0 is the slope (no slope, no change in y-value dependent on x-value)
and an offset (y-axis intersection) of 1.
A 45° up-slope would therefore have the values slope=1.0 and offset=0.0 (y=x). A 45° down-slope would look like slope=-1.0 and offset=1.0 (y=-x+1), etc..
This way, we are able to define any arbitrary slopes.</p>
<img alt="" src="_images/010_adding_the_offset_property_to_a_tile.png" />
<img alt="" src="_images/011_custom_properties_for_a_tile.png" />
<p>We will later add custom properties also to the other tiles in the <em>generic</em> tileset (when we talk about slopes in the next tutorial),
but for now, the fully filled red square will be enough to get us started. It will allow us to create a floor, some walls and a simple,
stairs-like structure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-collision-layer">
<h3>The Collision Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-collision-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The collision layer defines the location of walls and floors of our level. The players - and usually also the enemies - will collide with the single tiles
of this layer and thus cannot cross the barriers defined by it. This is where we will start: We will paint the floors and walls that make up our level.</p>
<p>Press <em>B</em> to activate the stamp brush tool (make sure the red square tile is still selected in the “generic” tileset in the Tilesets panel).
Paint a floor at the bottom of the level just like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="_images/012_drawing_a_floor.png" />
<p>Then paint a wall, some stairs, a hole and other structures like this (still only using that one red square tile):</p>
<img alt="" src="_images/013_walls_and_other_structures.png" />
<p>Finally, we need to let spygame know that the layer is a collision layer. Therefore, we will create a custom property on the layer itself.
We therefore single click on the “collision” layer in the Layers panel and then on the plus symbol in the Properties panel, which should now show the
properties of the layer (not some tile). This will add a new custom property
to the layer. We will call the property “type” (string) and give it a value of “default”.
The type property for layers (as well as objects later), determines the collision behavior of our spygame game objects.
“default” here just means, well, normal, like a wall or a floor are normal things to collide with.
We will later get to know the types “friendly”, “one_way_platform”, “dockable”,
“particle” and many other custom ones that we can define (and combine with each other) ourselves.</p>
<p>Also, by default, all layers in a level-tmx file will be rendered by spygame. Since we don’t want to see any collision tiles in the final level, we
need to set the “do_render” custom property to false. We do this by adding yet another property (click the plus button), select type <em>bool</em>, name the
new property “do_render” and then make sure to un-tick the check box (to set the value to false).</p>
<p>This concludes the work on our collision layer. Next, we’ll add some nice background and foreground graphics to our level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-background-layer">
<h3>The Background Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-background-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s do the background layer next.</p>
<p>We click on <em>Layer-&gt;New-&gt;Tile Layer</em> and rename the newly created layer in the Layer panel to be called “background”.</p>
<img alt="The background layer" src="_images/014_background_layer.png" />
<p>This time, we will not add a “type” property to the layer as the type will default to “none” (or 0), which means the layer won’t be considered for
any collisions. We also won’t need to set a do_render property as - by default - this one is true (and we do want the background layer to be rendered).
However, we do need to define a “render_order” (int) property and we will set that to 10 to make our background layer render quite early.
The “render_order” is just an int that defines the order in which a rendered layer object should be rendered. The lower the render_order, the earlier the
object gets rendered. Values can be chosen freely, but should be between 0 and 100, in order to keep some convention.</p>
<img alt="The customer properties of the new background layer" src="_images/015_properties_of_background.png" />
<p>Next, we paint the details of the layer and therefore we will need another tileset (we need nicer tiles than the ones in the the “generic” tileset).
We create a new tileset (just like we did before with the “generic” tileset) based on the egpt.png file in the images/ folder:</p>
<img alt="The egpt tileset" src="_images/016_the_egpt_tileset.png" />
<p>Make sure the background layer (and not the collision layer) is selected now.
By selecting more than one tile in the new egpt tileset (Tilesets panel) using mouse clicks on tiles while holding down CTRL, you can
create a larger brush and paint the level in fewer steps utilizing the
already given relations between the different tiles in the tileset. E.g.:</p>
<img alt="Drawing a palm tree using more than one tile from the tileset at a time" src="_images/017_using_more_than_one_tile_at_a_time.png" />
<p>Using the brush tool (press B) and maybe the eraser tool (press E), we can now draw our background layer. I recommend moving the background layer on top of
the collision layer in the Layers panel to be able to draw over the collision layer (and make the collision layer slowly disappear behind the new background
tiles). You can do so via the up and down arrow buttons at the bottom of the Layers panel.
Try to draw a background like the one in the image below. Don’t worry, since you have selected the background layer,
you will not erase anything in the collision layer. Only the currently selected layer gets changed:</p>
<img alt="A possible background setup could look like this" src="_images/018_a_possible_background_setup.png" />
<p>Your background doesn’t have to look exactly like the one above. Remember that the background is solely for graphical purposes and
it won’t have any effects on collisions, wall-, or obstacle design. This concludes the work on our background layer.
Next, we will add a palm tree to yet another layer, the foreground layer, to create the effect of the player moving behind a tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-foreground-layer">
<h3>The Foreground Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-foreground-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will now create another new layer, which will be quite similar to the background layer. Click on <em>Layer-&gt;New-&gt;Tile Layer</em> and rename the newly
created layer into “foreground”.
Then click on the foreground layer in the Layers panel and create the custom property: render_order(int)=100.
The value 100 makes sure that the foreground is rendered last. Everything we create now with render_order between 10 (background) and 100 (foreground) will seem
to be between the two layers (background and foreground) and allow us to create the typical pseudo 3D effect of all 2D
platformer games (we will later even add a so called “repeater”, which will strengthen the pseudo 3D effect even more).</p>
<p>Make sure the foreground layer is selected in the Layers panel and select any palm tree you like from the egpt tileset (select multiple tiles at once),
then brush the palm onto our foreground:</p>
<img alt="A possible foreground setup could look like this" src="_images/019_a_possible_foreground_setup.png" />
<p>This concludes all our tiled tile layers (collision, back- and foreground). Next we will introduce a new layer type, the so called “tiled object layer”.
These kinds of layers allow us to populate our level with game objects, like the player, the enemies, interesting objects (elevators, etc..) and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-object-layer">
<h3>The Object Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-object-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An object layer, also sometimes referred to as a “tiled object layer” is a loose collection of one or more objects, each of which can be represented by a single
tile. The tiles (objects) in an object layer are not nicely aligned horizontally and vertically, as it is the case in tiled tile layers (e.g. the background).
Rather, the positions of the objects are freely settable by the designer.</p>
<p>Let’s create our object layer and populate it with a first single object, the player.</p>
<p>We click on <em>Layer-&gt;New-&gt;Object Layer</em> and rename the new layer into “objects”. Object layers do not require any custom properties. Instead, we will set
properties directly on the objects with which we populate the object layer (see below).</p>
<img alt="The new &quot;tiled object layer&quot;" src="_images/020_new_object_layer.png" />
<p>Then it’s time again to create a new tileset (for our player hero).
We click on <em>Map-&gt;New Tileset</em> and chose the erik.png image file as the source for the new tileset. However, this time - before clicking on <em>OK</em> - we need
to set the tile width and height parameters to 32px (not 16px!):</p>
<img alt="Settings for the erik.tsx tileset" src="_images/021_setting_up_the_erik_tileset.png" />
<p>We make sure that the new object layer is selected in the Layers panel and
click on the very first tile in the erik tileset (the one where Erik is not doing really anything special). Then by clicking in the toolbar at the top of the
editor on the “Insert Tile” tool (or by pressing T) and by then clicking anywhere in the level, we can now place a single Erik into the level:</p>
<img alt="Placing an Erik object into the level" src="_images/022_placing_erik_into_the_level.png" />
<p>We change the tool from “Insert Tile” (T) to “Select Object” (S) and click on our new Erik. Now we can drag Erik around and place him somewhere else (or delete
him by hitting “del”). We have just created a new object in our tiled object layer.</p>
<p>When we select an object, we can set custom properties for only this object. All objects - by default - have the do_render property set to true and the
render_order property set to 50. Thus, if we needed to distinguish between foreground and background objects, we could override the render_order setting easily
by creating a new custom property “render_order” (int) and setting it to some value between 0 and 100. Note that values in our case lower than 11 would not
make sense as the object would otherwise be overwritten by the background layer during spygame’s rendering loop. Instead of tinkering with render
options, we need to set other properties to let spygame know, which spygame class to generate our object from (which constructor to call when building the
objects in the object layer). The spygame class to use as constructor gets defined via the already existing “Type” property of the object.
We will set this to “spygame.examples.vikings.Erik”:</p>
<img alt="Letting spygame know, which c'tor to use" src="_images/023_setting_eriks_constructor.png" />
<p>We also set the already existing “Name” property to “erik”, just for good practice.</p>
<p>Then we need to export the tileset for Erik into a separate file (a so called tsx file; not to be confused with tmx files!). This is necessary because
the constructor for an Erik object needs this tsx file to construct a sprite sheet from it, which again is used to animate the character. More on tsx-files
in a later tutorial. We click on the little “Export Tileset As” button at the bottom of the Tilesets panel (having the erik tileset as active one):</p>
<img alt="Exporting a tileset into a tsx file" src="_images/023a_exporting_eriks_tileset_as_tsx.png" />
<p>and save it inside the data/ folder of our project as “erik.tsx”.</p>
<p>And this will be all for now on our object layer.</p>
<p>To recap:
- The spygame engine will know by the Type field of each object, which constructor to use to build them. Classes defined directly in</p>
<blockquote>
<div>spygame must be preceded with a “spygame.”, classes from the examples extensions of spygame must be preceded with “spygame.examples.[some extension name].”,
and classes that you define yourself in your __main__ module would not need a preceding module name, instead you just put the plain class name into
the Type field.</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>spygame.examples.vikings.Erik objects have - by default - the ability to walk and jump through the level.
They require the erik.tsx file (for the tileset) to be available at construction time in order to animate the character.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will - on the next page - delve deeper into other spygame objects and show you how to set up each of them in the level-tmx file.</p>
<p>The last thing we will have to do now before testing our new level is to create the keyboard input definition for our level.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keyboard-event-setup">
<h2>Keyboard Event Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#keyboard-event-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this last step, we will tell spygame, which keys it should listen to while playing the level. Keyboard inputs in spygame are based on the pygame
nomenclature, which can be found in the first column of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html">this table here</a>. For example ‘K_UP’ is the pygame
short for the up-arrow. The spygame key names can be derived from these by dropping the preceding ‘<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">K_</span></a>’ and then converting the rest to all lower case.
For example: ‘K_UP’ becomes ‘up’, ‘K_RETURN’ becomes ‘return’, and ‘K_a’ becomes simply ‘a’.</p>
<p>In order to tell spygame, which keys to pay attention to during our game, we add a custom property to the global map object. Therefore, we click on
<em>Map-&gt;Map Properties</em>, then on the plus sign at the bottom of the Properties panel to add a new property and we call the property “keyboard_inputs”
and make it of type string. Then we assign a value of “up,down,left,right,space” to it,
which lets spygame know that we would like to listen to all arrow keys plus the space bar:</p>

<img alt="Defining the keys for spygame to listen to" src="_images/025_defining_keyboard_input_definitions.png" />
<p>This was the last thing we had to do in our level-tmx file. Now we are ready to write some basic python code against spygame and then play the level.
Remember to save the tmx file once more (under its current name: tutorial.tmx).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-to-get-level-running">
<h2>Code to get Level Running<a class="headerlink" href="#code-to-get-level-running" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We are now ready to create our python program in which we will load the tmx file and then play the level.
All the hard stuff was already done in the tmx file. All we have to do now is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a new python file in your project’s directory (the one in which you have the images/ and data/ folders). Name the new file “tutorial.py”</li>
<li>Start coding:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-python"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">spygame</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">spyg</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">spygame.examples.vikings</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">vik</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>This will import the spygame library as well as spygame’s “Lost Vikings” extension.</p>
<p>Then we will create a spygame.Game object that contains only one spygame.Level object our tmx-level (as a vik.VikingLevel object, which is a child
class of spygame.Level).
The different levels of a game are specified in the Game’s constructor via a list of dictionaries, each of which specifying the Level’s “class:”
(we use the vik.VikingLevel here, which supports the three player characters Erik, Olaf and Baleog; more on that later), the level’s “name:”
(which may be a reference to the equally named tmx file in the data/ directory without the .tmx extension),
and a numeric “id:”.</p>
<p>The title arg to the Game’s constructor defines the caption of the pygame window that will open up when the game is played.</p>

<p>This will only create the Game object, and not really do anything exciting (visible) yet. If you don’t want to hint to your tmx file via the name
of the Level object(s), you can pass an optional “tmx_file” arg to the screens_and_levels list like so:</p>

        <span class="p">},</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>Now, in order to actually play the level, you have to access the VikingLevel object inside the Game object and tell this level to play:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>15</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">game</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">levels_by_name</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;TUTORIAL&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">play</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>Make sure the quoted string in the above line matches the name you gave to the level.</p>
<p>This should open up a pygame window of automatic size (the size of the level-tmx map) that looks like this:</p>
<img alt="Erik being happy to finally be able to jump around in his new home" src="_images/026_erik_jumping_around_in_the_level.png" />
<p>You can move Erik around in the level via the arrow keys as well as the space bar (for jumping). He will have to jump in order to reach the top of the hill
in the right part of the level. We will talk about replacing the stairs-structure with smooth slopes in the next tutorial.</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the platformer tutorial. In the next part, we will delve deeper into spygame’s built-in objects and possibilities
and add some of them to our level-tmx file: Slopes to get rid of the ugly stairs-like structure in our current level, an elevator to go up and down,
a moving rock that Erik can push around (if he puts enough effort into it), a fire spitter (use with caution!), a ladder,
and - of course - a dangerous monster.</p>
