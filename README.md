# spygame
## 2D game engine based on Pygame and level-tmx files

### 1) Getting started
* Git the [spygame](www.github.com/sven1977/spygame) code or do a `pip install spygame`
* write a simple game against the engine:

```python
import spygame as spyg


class MyAgent(spyg.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y, spritesheet):
        super().__init__(x, y, spritesheet)

        # some custom settings
        self.handles_own_collisions = True  # our agent handles its own collisions (instead of letting the Stage do it for us)
        # add a Brain for keyboard input handling
        self.cmp_brain = self.add_component(spyg.Brain("brain", ["up", "down", "left", "right"]))
        # add a physics component to physics handling (here we use: simple 2D top-down view and controls)
        self.cmp_physics = self.add_component(spyg.TopDownPhysics("physics"))

    # plain spyg.Sprite objects do not implement the `tick` function, so nothing ever happens with them
    # - we need to implement it here to add the pre-tick event (this will trigger the brain and physics components to act)
    def tick(self, game_loop):
        # tell our subscribers (e.g. Components) that we are ticking
        self.trigger_event("pre_tick", game_loop)


# create a spyg.Game object
game = spyg.Game(screens_and_levels=[
    # the only level
    {
        "class": spyg.Level, "name": "MAZE", "id": 1,
    },

    # add more of your levels here
    # { ... },

], title="The Maze Runner - An A-maze-ing Game :)")

# that's it, play one of the levels -> this will enter an endless game loop
game.levels_by_name["MAZE"].play()
```

All you need in order to run this game is the above code in a directory, and the additional subdirectories data/ and images/, which can
be found [here](www.github.com/sven1977/spygame/tree/master/examples/maze_runner)

This should give you a level like:
